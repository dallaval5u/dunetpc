This directory contains the python scripts used to train the infill networks in InfillChannels_module.cc.

Training was done with PDSPProd2_protoDUNE_sp_detsim_p3GeV_35ms_sce_datadriven data so networks are 
configured for 800x6000 (induction view) and 480x6000 images (collection view).

To setup python environment do 'conda env create -f infill_py2.yaml'.


Workflow for training a model is:

run_MakeInfillTrainingData.fcl -> data_prepare.py -> train.py -> make_tscript.py

Use predict.py to check the performance of the trained model.
